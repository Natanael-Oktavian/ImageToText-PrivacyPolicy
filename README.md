# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the OCR Android app ("the app") developed by Natanael Oktavian

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The app does *not collect*, store, or share any personal data from users.

## 2. Image Processing

Users can either:
- *Select an image file* from their device storage, or
- *Capture a photo* using the device’s camera.

The selected or captured image is processed *locally on the device* using *Google ML Kit’s on-device Text Recognition (OCR)*.  
No images or text data are uploaded, stored, or transmitted to any server.

## 3. Permissions Used

Camera access: The app may open your device’s camera via system tools when you choose to take a photo. The app does not access the camera directly or store images.
Image selection: You may optionally select an image from your device for text recognition. The app processes the image locally and does not upload or store it.

## 4. Third-party Services

The app uses *Google ML Kit’s on-device text recognition*, which processes images locally and does not transmit data externally.

## 5. Security

As the app does not store or transmit any data, user privacy and security are inherently preserved.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Changes will be reflected in this document.

## 7. Contact
