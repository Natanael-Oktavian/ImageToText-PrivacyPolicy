# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the OCR Android app ("the app") developed by Natanael Oktavian

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The app does *not collect*, store, or share any personal data from users.

## 2. Image Processing

Users can either:
- *Select an image file* from their device storage, or
- *Capture a photo* using the device’s camera.

The selected or captured image is processed *locally on the device* using *Google ML Kit’s on-device Text Recognition (OCR)*.  
No images or text data are uploaded, stored, or transmitted to any server.

## 3. Permissions Used

- *Camera (optional):* Used only to capture images for text recognition. The camera is not used unless the user explicitly chooses to take a photo.
- *Storage access (optional):* Used only to select an image file for OCR processing.

These permissions are requested at runtime and are not required to use all parts of the app.

## 4. Third-party Services

The app uses *Google ML Kit’s on-device text recognition*, which processes images locally and does not transmit data externally.

## 5. Security

As the app does not store or transmit any data, user privacy and security are inherently preserved.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated in the future. Changes will be reflected in this document.

## 7. Contact
